     <h3>About us</h3>
       <p>We are a team dedicated to bringing consistent support to every TB<br/>
    patient in Kenya. Through informed discussions with healthcare <br/>
    providers and TB patients, we believe daily presence in a patientâ€™s<br/>
    life will go a long way to fostering complete adherence to medication.</p>
    
    <p>We understand how hard it is to adhere to medication and in particular<br/>
    TB medication with which missing a single day is always a burden and<br/>
    a risk to start medication or die. Our goal is to enable every patient to<br/>
    achieve  successful treatment</p>
